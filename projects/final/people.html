            <p>The father of video games, the idol of all game developers-designers, the person who made Nintendo what it is today.
            He started designing games by urgently making a game to be sent to the U.S. branch from a toy company that he joined with his father's connections. 
            That game is the first platformer game and Super Mario's debut, Donkey Kong. 
            He has since been involved in dozens of or hundreds of game productions, as designers, directors, and producers, and he has been involved in hardware development from Super Famicom to Nintendo Wii. 
            He is the definately the best and most valueable person in Nintendo, and also he is my most admire game designer.
            There are numerous anecdotes, wise sayings, lessons, etc. about to him, but the page will be very longer if I write all of them down.

            <p>Originally from HAL Laboratory, Inc., Nintendo's one of flagship second party known for "Kirby", he was a well-known genius programmer in the company. 
                He was scouted by Nintendo in 2000 and became the fourth CEO of Nintendo in 2002.
                He had a huge impact on Nintendo and other affiliates as well as HAL Labs. 
                Typically, he contributed the most to success of Pokémon as the series. 
                He made the Gold & Silver version's capacity compression program, which allowed the Gold & Silver version to be produced safely with all the design & game play included. 
                Also, there was a game he and his colleague made as weekend hobby, which was the Super Smash Bros.
                He focused on developing Nintendo's devices until his death in 2015 at the age of 55.
                One of the most touching words he has ever said is "On my business card, I am a company president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer."

            <p>He is considered the leading contributor to Nintendo's era of leap forward and the father of portable game consoles and VR gaming.
            After graduating from college, he got a job as a factory equipment and maintenance worker for a small company in his hometown, which was Nintendo. 
            One day, under the direction of Nintendo's third CEO, Hiroshi Yamauchi, Yokoi becomes the leader of the newly established R&D team. 
            As the team leader, he developed a variety of children's toys and 'Game & Watch' to revive Nintendo from the bankruptcy crisis. 
            And also, while developing Donkey Kong for 'Game & Watch', he came up with a Directional-PAD that is the standard for all controllers today.
            After the company began to focus on the video game business in earnest with the release of FamilyCom (or Famicom, Nintendo Entertainment System-NES as U.S. version), it produced games such as Kid Icarus, Metroid, and Fire Emblem, and later began developing Game Boy, a portable game machine. Game Boy was released in 1989 and enjoyed much more popularity than the Famicom.
            In the early 1990s, he was impressed by VR technology and pushed for the development of Virtual Boy, the world's first commercialized VR game machine, just before retiring.
            He then quit Nintendo and died in a car accident in 1997 at the age of 56.
