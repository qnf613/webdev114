                <p>A game series featuring Nintendo's Mario. The founder is Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo's flagship franchise and mascot, which has received critical acclaim and recognition 
                    worldwide, has been the most sold video game series of all. As it is a game series that has had the biggest impact on the development of video games, many people regard 
                    it as a symbol of modern video games beyond a symbol of Nintendo. The original series is a Super Mario series, but the popularity of the character Mario has increased, and
                     variations such as the Mario Kart series and the Mario Party series have since emerged. Those series are also as popular as the original series, so the Mario series is one
                      of the few franchises that both the main series and the spin-off series have hit jackpot.

                The Legend of Zelda

                <p>It is a series of action adventure games produced and released by Nintendo, starting with "The Legend of Zelda" in 1986.  The founder is Shigeru Miyamoto.
                    Although it has a narrative and acts on the field, it is a game that is close to an action adventure in that JRPG's unique workhouse has few elements and has strong 
                    puzzleability. The official genre is also an action adventure. In addition, some 3D series include manipulation such as TPS, FPS, gun shooting, and various mini-games, 
                    making it difficult to conclude the genre as one. It's more like a total game that implies all genres as one.
                    There have been countless Zelda legend games since Zelda's legend, but it has been steadily loved by many fans because it has the same basic story and characters.
                    Along with the Super Mario series, it is also listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as a model game for numerous game developers, regardless of the East and West.
                    It is a series that is evaluated as an optimal combination of action, puzzle, and storytelling, and it is also a series that boasts excellent entertainment and original 
                    artistry in all fields such as art, music, and story.
                    In particular, the dungeon of elaborate puzzles, which requires structural thinking, is a tradition and feature of the Zelda legend series. The "puzzlebox type" dungeon, 
                    defined in the Trifos of the Gods, has had a profound impact on later games, and the 3D "puzzlebox type" dungeon, which began with the Ocarina of Time, is still a feature 
                    of Zelda, where no latecomers are found.

                <p>Pokémon is a generic term for the game series and media mixes such as television comics/comic/TCG based on that game series released by Pokémon Company, or fictional creatures
                     in those series.
                    It is a global best content called a global cultural phenomenon, recording the world's largest media mix sales (about 102 billion dollars). This is equivalent to the combined
                     sales of Star Wars and Marvel Cinematic Universe, which are the epitome of big media franchises (70 billion dollars and 40 billion dollars, respectively). The Pokémon series
                      sold about 368 million copies, ranking second after the Mario series, and is also the best-selling series of all RPGs worldwide.
                    When it first came out, the appearance of cute and creative Pokémon was enough to excite young children around the world, and later it became popular not only among teenagers
                     but also among adults. It is the strongest soft power that represents Japan like popular cartoons and games in Japan.

                <p>The "Kirby" series is an action game series developed by HAL Laboratory and released by Nintendo in 1992 by "Kirby."
                The first director is Masahiro Sakurai, and Shinya Kumazaki has been the director since Masahiro Sakurai stepped down from the series after the release of "Kirby & The Amazing 
                Mirror" in 2004. The game features children's game-like appearance with a peaceful atmosphere, mostly set in Planet Popstar and Dream Land, as well as lively, exciting and 
                addictive BGM and cute characters. In particular, Kirby, the main character, is a soft pink ball-like creature and is very popular for its simple yet attractive character.
                However, the perception that it is simply a children's game is close to preconceived notions. In fact, many of the fans of the Kirby series of stars are attracted to the unique 
                progression of the game itself. First of all, hovering, the ability to absorb air and inflate the body and float in the air, is the basic movement in most series. Thanks to this, 
                there are relatively few restrictions on movement even though it is a horizontal scroll game. It is also possible to fly and avoid all enemies without having to kill them while 
                passing by, or to fly through lava zones if you have good control. Kirby's various copying skills, such as his symbol, are also very different from other action games.

                Metroid
            </h3>

                <img alt="metroid" src="images/games/metroid.png" width="300px"  class="warpleft">
                <p>It is a series of action adventure games produced and released by Nintendo, starting with Metroid in 1986. It is the etymological of "metro"vania, which started as a 2D 
                    cross-scroll shooter.
                    The name comes from Metro + Android. The power suit with a lot of shoulder pads, the morph ball rolling around the body, the starting melody, and the jingle melody when 
                    acquiring items are the symbolic elements of the elements of the series. None of these three changes in any series.
                    Since it is a stage, such as the underground ruins of a planet occupied by metroids and a space base where all humans died, there are few interlocutors who can meet during 
                    the game, and there are few elements such as communication that give directions, and there are no shops from beginning to end. The BGM has also improved a lot with a lot of 
                    songs with chorus from the Prime series, but it is still full of a gloomy Cosmic Horror-style atmosphere. I feel like the main character is a lonely warrior who has to handle
                     everything alone. This atmosphere continued to Metroid Prime, which came out as GameCube, but the feeling of loneliness disappeared a lot in Metroid Fusion, which came out as
                      Game Boy Advance. Of course, the horror element still exists in later series.
                    It is the most mania-favored, hard-core series, and the most heterogeneous but most familiar with Nintendo's development rules, and the vicious difficulty that can be explained
                     by the word unfriendly to the genre of 2D exploration was considered a tremendous innovation, but surprisingly, later series tend to combine existing successful games rather 
                     than experimental innovation. It combines successful games at that time and complements the gameability that may be somewhat familiar with hard-core difficulty and atmosphere. 
                     Therefore, even though it is the Nintendo series that shows the most heterogeneous atmosphere, it is considered to be the series that faithfully observes the Nintendo development
                      principle of "horizontal thinking of high technology."

                <p>It is a series of fighting action games developed by Masahiro Sakurai and released by Nintendo, and is a crossover fighting action game in which famous characters from Nintendo
                     gather together to fight.
                    Because of this game series, GameCube Controllers are still being released for generations.
                    In addition to simple manipulation, unusual stages, and characters familiar with low barriers to entry due to items, it is easy for light users to enjoy, and it also adopts a 
                    number of deep systems as a full-fledged fighting game, so hard users can be satisfied.
                    There are many different factors from ordinary fighting games because it is a game designed on a competitive basis called Antitezera. First of all, the winning condition of the
                     battle fighting game, "Make the opponent's HP zero," is not works. The only way to KO the opponent is to fly the opponent out of the screen. Fighters have no physical strength
                      and there is a system called "accumulative damage." Cumulative damage starts at 0% and accumulates more and more damage, and the longer the distance to attack increases.

                <p>Nintendo's console TPS game IP. It is the new IP of Nintendo's Information Development Headquarters (EAD), which started with the TPS game Splatoon, released as Nintendo's 
                    console Wii U in 2015. It is the first new IP of EAD in 14 years since the release of the Peakmin series, and it was also the last franchise released by EAD before EAD was 
                    integrated with SPD to become EPD in 2015.
                    It is a worldview that evolved to adapt marine life to land in the distant future after mankind disappeared due to rising sea levels. The key content is that the inklings 
                    evolved from squid are the main characters, and the game called "area battle" is played by spraying ink with a water gun to win the team with a wider area.
                    It is now one of the leading brands of the company, a generational signal that has upset Nintendo's concerns about the future.
                    Thanks to its unique and cute design and casual gameplay, which is unique and not like a shooting game, it has gained worldwide popularity since its launch. The first movie,
                     Splatoon, is also famous for playing a relief pitcher at the end of the failed Wii U. Nintendo has been criticized for lacking novelty and stagnating IP, and there has been
                      constant concern about generational changes since Shigeru Miyamoto and Satoru Iwata, and Splatoon has shown unprecedented freshness, and has now grown to represent 
                      Nintendo's IP, with comparable popularity with Mario and Zelda series.
